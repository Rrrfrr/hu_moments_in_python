Python version : 3.5 (tested in version 3.5 but as there're no big changes in python
                 standard, it can be used with other versions).
                 
                 
Comments       : This implementation uses only python standard functions, but it
                 can be used also with numpy arrays.
                 So, the program is ready for an numpy array. No adaptation is needed.
